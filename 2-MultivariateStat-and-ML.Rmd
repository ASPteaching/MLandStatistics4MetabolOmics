# Omics data are high dimensional

- So far, our analyses are dealing with a single variable (i.e. univariate analysis)

  - T-tests: one variable, two groups
  - ANOVA: one variable, > 2 groups
  
- Even when we analyze many variables, we proceed *one at a time*
  - Determine how to analyze one single variable separatedly
  - Apply the procedure to all variables, 
  - Perform multiple test adjustment
  
- This is not wrong, but, at least it can be criticized because interactions (correlations) are missed.

- Even if we attempt to account for interactions, visualization are limited to three dimensions.

- So the question arises of __*How can we analyze & visualize high-dimensional data in a global ("holistic") way, that is considering all data together?*__

# The analysis of high dimensional data

- The classical approach to analyzing high dimensional data is Multivariate Statistics which orginates in the early 20th century.
  - Pearson 1901, Hottelling 1933: Principal Components Analysis
  - TW Anderson (1958): First Multivariate Statistics (as we know today) book
  
- Although classical MV Statistics considered Exploratory Analysis it was strongly rooted in Statistical Modelling and Distribution theory.

- By the end of the 20th century, as computing power became available and data did not stop growing many aspects of multivariate statistics were re-casted from the side of computer science
  - Their approach was not so much in modelling multivariate distributions but on the algorithms.
  
- The underlying idea of this *Machine Learning* approach is that instead of focussing on a model, we focus on howw to build an algorithm to solve a certain problem given a set of of examples.

- This lead to the idea of *Learning from Data*

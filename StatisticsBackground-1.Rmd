```

---

# The Data for the Analysis

- At the end of the data generation process we end up with similar types of data such as *Peak intensities, Concentrations*, usually organize in some type of rectangular  *features* $\times$ *samples* tables.

- These are, somehow, linked, to complementary information  (sample groups, metabolite names ...), generally kown as the study *metadata*.


```{r out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='A possible organization of data and metadata using an Excel spreadsheet'}
knitr::include_graphics("1-StatisticsBackground_insertimage_6.png")
```

---

# Metadata organization

- Typically *metadata* is intended to provide information on:
  - Samples characteristics or experimental groups
  - Variable names and other characteristics (e.g. is ametabolite *endogene* or *exogene*)
  - Study characteristic such as the platform, technology or other data generation characteristics.

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Metadata can be provided as separate pieces of information'}
knitr::include_graphics("1-StatisticsBackground_insertimage_7.png")
```

---

# Metadata management

- Some software libraries like [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) provide specific  structures to allow the integrated management of data and metadata.
- This is a powerful approach, but requires some level of expertise and is far from being universally adopted.

```{r out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("1-StatisticsBackground_insertimage_9.png")
```

---

# Metadata integrated with data

- Metadata can be combined with features values in the same file. 
- This simplifies data management, but may have a poorer metadata

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("1-StatisticsBackground_insertimage_8.png")
```

---

# Omics data structure

- As with many other OMICS, Metabol*omics* data are high throughput, 
- This, in practice, means often having more variables than samples.
- It also imposes some restrictions to the analysis methods that can be used on the data.

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Traditional datasets (left) have more samples(K) than variables (N), while omics datasets (right) may have more features than samples $K>>N$'}

# Data pre-processing


---

# Data may not be that good

- Omics data are high throughput which, in practice, means there is a huge number of values to deal with.

- These values may be affected by the process that has generated them, which may have experienced unexpected issues.

- Even if nothing went wrong there may be **noise**, some values may be **missing**, others may be unexpectedly big or small (**outliers**).

---

# Quality control and preprocessing

.pull-left[

- The data usually undergo a series of iterative steps where they are 
  - checked, 
  - eventually adjusted to correct some detcted problem and
  - re-checked to find out if the problem has been corrected.
]

.pull-right[

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("1-StatisticsBackground_insertimage_11.png")
```
]

- Here we don't go into pre-processing details, because they are discussed elsewhere.

- We only consider them in what they may affect statistical analysis.

---

# Missing values (MV)

.pull-left[

- Due to either signal truncation, failures in peak detection or true missings.

- Cn lead to biased results, reduced statistical power, and invalid conclusions.

- MV are usually imputed as mean/mode imputation, k-nearest neighbors, or multiple imputation techniques.

- Failure to address can distort parameter estimates and increase type I/II errors.

```
]

---

# Outlier Detection (OD)

.pull-left[

- Extreme values that don't seem to fit with the data
- Can skew results, affect mean/variance, and lead to misleading inferences.
- Detection through variability measures in normal or reduced dimensions.
- Treatment: remove, adjust, or analyze separately.
-  Ignoring outliers can result in inflated errors and biased parameter estimates.

# Sample Normalization (SN)

.pull-left[

- Variation in data acquisition can introduce systematic biases, affecting comparability across samples.

- Normalization aim at making samples comparable while keeping the ability to detect eventual differences

- Many methods exist from simple median normalization to many elaborate approaches.

# Evaluate normalization effects

.pull-left[

- How can we know that normalization has produced the expected effect?

- Distinct criteria may lead to distinct choices but

- It is always a good idea to try to evaluate how well does any preprocessing method.

# Data Transformations

.pull-left[

- Data may be skewed and/or heteroscedastic, violating certain test assumptions.

- Normalizing transformations (log, sqrt, etc.) may stabilize variance and approach normality.

- Proper transformation ensures that statistical assumptions are met, enhancing the validity of inferential statistics.

# Scaling

.pull-left[

- Data with different ranges and units, cause high-variance metabolites to dominate multivariate analyses.

- Solved by scaling  the data using standardization (z-score) or unit variance scaling.

- Without scaling, statistical methods like PCA or clustering may be biased towards high-variance features, misrepresenting the true data structure.

# Preprocessing in summary

.pull-left[

- The output of preprocessing steps is a cleaner, more homogeneous dataset.

- This does not necessarily mean this is a better dataset!

- Steps should not be taken blindly, but carefully
  - Their need and their effect must be assessed.
  - When in doubt, leave things unchanged.
  - Or ask your favourite bioinformatician.

# Exploratory Analysis

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

.pull-left[

- It refers to any calculation or figure that provides information about a dataset.

- The first thing (sometimes the only thing) to do in a Data Analysis.

- It impregnates every step in the omics data analysis process
  - Quality checks
  - Data exploration
  - Statistical test (check asumptions, visualize results)
  - Statistical modeling (check assumptions, visualize model fit)

# Univariate vs Multivariate EDA

.pull-left[

- Omics data are high dimensional (multivariate): 1 dimension/feature.

- Features are related to each other.

- This leads to consider multivariate statistics as the natural way to try to understand data structure
  - The relation between features.
  - The similarity between individuals.

- This is may be complex and not necessarily informative.
  - It is usually complemented by uni and bi-variate exploration

# Initial Data Examination

  - [Which/How many/What type of] variables, 

  - [Which/How many] samples
  
  - Are there some/many missing values?
  
- Obtain simple summary statistics and plots

-  Visualize the data, try to get a grasp of variables and individuals

# Numerical summaries

- If the number of features is not huge, they provide useful information

- Location estimates: Mean, Median, Mode, quantils

- Dispersion estimates: Variance, Standard deviation, interquartile range

- For relation between variables we can estimate the covariance between two variables qhich measures their degree of linear association.
- Covariance depends on the units of the variables. 
  - Use the correlation coefficent to have a unitless scale.
  - Always consider Pearson and Spearman (Ranks) coefficient.
  
- Other measures are also useful, but less used
  - E.g. Skewness is a measure of the simmetry of the variable. Values outside [-1, +1] suggest skewed distributions.

# Don't confuse features with observations!


- In classical statistics we always think of summarizing or plotting variables.
- In omics data it is common to summarize/plot samples
  - It can be done, it may be useful
  - But it does not mean the same.



- The lines below show the mean an sd of each sample

- The columns on the right show the mean an sd of each variable.

- They are different. They don't mean the same!

# The *king* of graphical summaries

- Boxplots provide a condensed representation of a distribution, based on quartiles and outliers.

- Being a flat representation, it facilitates comparisons.

# From uni/bivariate to multivariate EDA

- Omics data are high dimensional
- Because of this, it makes full sense to try to look *at all variables at once*
- Although possible in moderate settings it is generally very difficult to extract useful information.
- An alternative is to rely on dimension reduction methods, that retain some/most information and project it to lower dimensional spaces where this can be visualized,

- For this we will go through a series of Multivariate Exploratory (Unsupervised) techniques.
